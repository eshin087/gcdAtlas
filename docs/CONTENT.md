# Content: what exists, what is next

## What is already in the atlas

**`docs/CATALOG.md` is the source of truth.** It is generated from the built page (`npm run catalog`), so it cannot drift from the code: every object with its key, name, group, category, distance, true size, number of camera angles, whether it has a flyby, and the file it is defined in. Check it before adding anything, and regenerate it after.

## The checklists the atlas follows (owner, 2026-10-04)

Deep-sky objects come from two public lists, so the atlas grows in a consistent, trackable order:

- **Messier** (110 objects, the classic list; SEDS, messier.seds.org) first, then
- **Caldwell** (109 objects, Patrick Moore, 1995: the bright objects Messier missed, both hemispheres).

Both lists are in `tools/data/deep-sky.mjs`. `npm run catalog` matches them against every object's `aka` and writes a done and missing table for each at the end of `docs/CATALOG.md`: an object counts once its `aka` holds the number (`m27`, `ngc 6853`; a Caldwell row counts by its NGC or IC number, or a `c63` in `aka`). So the missing rows are the to-do list, and nothing has to be ticked off by hand.

**SIMBAD** (CDS, simbad.cds.unistra.fr) is the authority for names, catalogue numbers and positions: take RA and Dec in degrees from it (`simbadPos` in `src/objects/p8-messier.js`) and put every Messier, NGC and IC number it lists for the object in `aka`. Distances and sizes come from the best current measurement (Gaia DR3 inside the Milky Way, Baumgardt & Vasiliev for globular clusters, Cosmicflows-4 or a direct method for galaxies), named in the readout and in `docs/ACCURACY.md`.

Everything the two lists do not cover stays on our own curated backlog below: black holes, planets of other stars, the Solar System, explosions, the largest structures, human-made things and Earth (`docs/EARTH_PLAN.md`).

## How to add a pack

1. Pick about 20 objects: from the empty checklist rows in `docs/CATALOG.md`, or from the curated backlog below. Mark the pack *in progress* here.
2. Create `src/objects/pN-name.js`. One pack per theme. Reuse helpers before writing new ones: `addGalaxy` (06g-galaxies.js) with `galAt` / `discR0` for a real position angle and tilt, `addGlobular`, `gaiaOpenCluster` (an open cluster from its Gaia members; its data from `tools/cluster-stars.mjs`), the star-nursery shader `FS_NURSERY` (p8-messier.js; kinds 0 to 3), `addRingPN` and `clusterPS` (p1-nebulae.js), `namedStar`, `addBody`, `addProbe`. A pack that draws from `rnd()` saves `seed` at its start and puts it back at its end.
3. Every object: real position (SIMBAD), true size, a sourced fact, a readout with numbers, 2 or 3 views including one close and dramatic, `aka` search words with its catalogue numbers (`m31 ngc 224`), a `sortKey`. Big objects: add them to `FLYBY_OBJ` in `src/objects/z8-flybys.js`.
   - Atlas place: `group` is its one heading (`GROUPS` in `src/09-render.js`: solar, comets, stars, worlds, nebulae, galaxies, cosmic, travel). `tags` put it in more kinds (`CATS`, the grid of filters in the atlas): `moons` (moons and small worlds), `events` (explosions and collisions), `clusters` (star clusters), `human` (human-made; `addProbe` adds it). Planets of other stars go in `worlds` (`exoPlanet` does this). When an object is not what its heading says, `atlasKind` sets its main kind (the S-stars sit under Galaxies & black holes but are `stars`); do not use `kind`, which is the surface shader's number on planets and moons.
4. Have a separate agent research the numbers and check the facts against NASA, ESA, SIMBAD and the papers before shipping (in 0.16.0 this corrected the distance or size of more than half of the 20).
5. Consider: a tour stop (`src/08t-tours.js`; Messier objects join the Messier marathon by themselves), a ship destination (`SHIP_TARGETS` in `src/07-extras.js`), a ladder rung (`LADDER` in `src/09-render.js`) for iconic scales.
6. Screenshot every view, `npm test`, `npm run catalog`, changelog line, patch notes.

## Backlog

Status: `planned`, `in progress`, `done` (then it appears in CATALOG.md and can be removed from here).
